Jujutsu Kaisen Chapter 166 Links + Discussion,http://www.reddit.com/r/JuJutsuKaisen/comments/qywpw9/jujutsu_kaisen_chapter_166_links_discussion/,140,713,"['Yuji is EXACTLY the type of person Higuruma got into law to defend', 'oh i love this', ""Yo Higuruma's ability is so broken with the death penalty aspect💀💀. In the context of the culling game it's even perfect and makes complete sense how he got 100 points.  I feel he is what nanami was originally meant to be when gege was initially talking about the direction he wanted to take his character in. Happy with the conclusion of this battle , since he was a good guy deep down"", 'I completely agree with the comparison about Nanami! I’m looking forward to learning more about his past, he’s a really cool character!', 'Lol not a broken office worker but a broken lawyer', 'Higuruma, my man! I’m so glad Yuuji got to hear that the deaths of all those people in Shibuya weren’t his fault- it’s important for him to hear.', 'He was only guilty of blaming himself :(', ""Yeah I'm so glad and relieved Yuuji finally gets to have this talk! - and in this proper sit down way too. In terms of the guilt he carries - he's needed someone to talk to him this frankly since the beginning of the series. Nanami did a decent job for a time when Yuuji blamed himself about Junpei or was getting hung up on killing Mahito's cursed human hybrids. But for his biggest guilt, shibuya massacre, he's just been carrying it around without any time to really process how he feels past the guilt."", ""Gege's cruel streak has been running strong for a while now, but I'm really grateful for this. And for it to fit so seamlessly in the story with Higurama being a fantastic new character."", ""I mean tbf, multiple people have told Yuji that Shibuya wasn't his fault, but it doesn't seem like he can accept that yet. This is just one part of probably a long character arc for him"", 'I’m glad he gets to hear it from someone who’s also not biased. As much as his friends tell him it’s not his fault, I just know he wouldn’t take their words to heart. But hearing it from a stranger who knows little about him, but the curse living inside is the perfect way to ease his mind a bit.', 'Best chapter in ages, Higurama has been a fantastic addition to the cast and the art was on point. Loved this fight so much.', ""Gege continues to be in his bag with this one. It's early but the Culling Game is picking right up with Shibuya levels of quality."", 'Higuruma is quickly becoming one of my favorite characters', 'Same, absolutely love the character. Means he’ll probably die a very sad death then', ""It feels so exhilarating to see Yuuji shining so bright in this chapter. His growth, in terms of power and strength, has been insane. Love to see him in all his glory. And to know that he doesn't even have a CT, especially in an Universe where every other character posses one. It's just pure physical strength."", ""Not quite following what exactly you mean. Didn't we already know that Yuuji was a physical beast from the very beginning. Recently when Yuta met Yuuji we saw a panel where he mentions how Yuta is the opposite of how he was when he started out with jujutsu."", 'Toji says hi', 'As predicted, Higuruma sympathised with Yuji in the end and they sat down and began to talk.', 'I’m truly happy with how this arc went. Higuruma is such a fascinating character and another interesting take on the vastly different morals this series has delved into. I do think Higuruma is a good character at heart, but is perfectly capable of seeing the need in getting his hands dirty, while also remaining disillusioned to the whole end justifies the means.', 'He went off the deep end, that’s true, but sort of like Peter B Parker he can’t bring himself to go against his morals, the reasons he became a Defense attorney. He saw Yuji weak and in need of a Defense attorney, from the judge man, from Yuji himself, and he had to defend.', 'I also think that Higuruma thinks somewhat poorly of himself, which is why he refuses to become a judge cause he knows his view of the world isn’t good. Higuruma is just such a good character and I hope to see him more', 'Loved that last question in the chapter where Higuruma asked Itadori if killing felt awful. Reminded me of how this series can be dark and violent without being overly edgy and making human life seem worthless. Great stuff', ""Yeah, think i agree with the edgy part. Jjk doesn't over exaggerate things except in necessary situations such as sorcerers going feral scenes (can this count as edgy tho idk lol). While edginess isn't necessarily bad, it can be annoying if it's overdone imo."", ""Higuruma is a cool dude, I hope he sticks around, but this being JJK, I'd be surprised if he survives. I'm also guessing that after we get his backstory next chapter, he and Yuji will depart ways and Higuruma will be out of the story for now. I'd be cool if Higuruma joined Yuji, but I don't expect that to happen"", 'Also, my memory is so terrible, but who is the person that Yuji willingly killed besides cursed monsters that were once human??', ""The death womb painting brothers. Eso crying really fucked with his head, even with Nobara's reassurances that they did the right thing."", 'Nah I think Higurama might stick around for a while longer. He just about fits the void Nanami left while being his own thing (and dare I say an upgrade? dont kill me, nanami is my fav, just thinking in terms of character use in the story). To have him only in it a little would be a waste.', ""Didn't think about it until just now, but with his whole thing being about the law and against corrupt failed systems, that might lead him into the overarching plot of the whole jjk bureaucratic world being a broken mess in need of reform."", 'Jujutsu sorcerers', 'Exorcising curses']"

There was a drawing for both these clarifications in which Inumaki (as a first year) does a mission in Yujis hometown and they cross each others path.

This sub is oversaturated with fan art and cosplay,http://www.reddit.com/r/JuJutsuKaisen/comments/r8kkti/this_sub_is_oversaturated_with_fan_art_and_cosplay/,76,465,"[""I don't want to seem like a hater, there's a lot of beautiful fan art and well-crafted cosplay. However, it's so rare to find posts actually discussing the manga/anime itself. I often reminisce to the days of older anime forums such as onemanga where users would engage in really fun and heated debates and discussions about the story, characters, power systems, and theories. I wish this sub was more like that. Jujutsu Kaisen is by far my favorite form of fiction right now and I would love to actually discuss it with fellow fans of the series, it's just tiresome to sift through the endless amounts of art and cosplay, which is cool, but doesn't really focus on the genius of Gege Akutami's work, rather the OP's work. To see people's actual thoughts on elements of the story/characters etc. I often have to go elsewhere. I think this subreddit would benefit a lot from either creating fan art/cosplay/meme megathreads or designate specific days for those posts so that we can actually talk about Jujutsu Kaisen. Thanks for reading my mini-rant."", 'tl/dr: This sub is over-saturated with fan art and cosplay; genuine discussion/debate is hard to find.', 'Most of those convos have shifted to r/jujutsushi since there are less spoiler rules to worry about. That’s always my go-to for discussions, so I have no issue with the artwork and cosplays, etc I find here', ""I didn't know about this sub until about an hour ago, been going through the posts and like wow; some amazing discussions going on over there. Really in-depth stuff!"", 'A majority of people who are going to like something are going to be casual fans. So, most people who like JuJutsu Kaisen are going to just watch the anime because it’s the easiest to get into. Most people involved in anime are only going to watch the anime and not read the original story through the manga.', 'Then there’s the fact that the anime is only 1 season long and we don’t have anything close to the second season on the horizon. The first season is merely the introduction to the series where there wasn’t much of an over arching storyline. The story is mostly surface level right now without really knowing a lot of stuff that’s happening in the background. All anime only watchers know is that the curses have stolen many things from the sorcerers, like 10 fingers of Sukuna and a device called the Prison Realm. They also know that the curses have no intention of directly fighting Satoru Gojo by any means necessary. They have no idea of what’s going to happen on Halloween and why it’s important that the curses have a JuJutsu Sorcerer amongst them.', 'So what’s there to be excited about in this story so far? I think the characters are the biggest draw to the anime. All of the characters are quirky and funny, yet serious and deep at the same time. They’re well written and people enjoy these types of characters that are more than just surface level. We have extremely well written female characters that aren’t just pretty, and strong, and a love interest for the main characters or a love triangle between important characters. These characters go through real problems that many people go through in their real lives, some may be a little over exaggerated for story telling purposes but at one point in history, these challenges were extremely similar and traditionalists still think that these challenges are necessary to implement.', 'There’s been a drought for a while on content for casual JuJutsu watchers. There’s nothing more they can really talk about, unless it’s the same things about the same characters for the 400th time. So people want to get creative with their interest for the show. Drawing and cosplay are popular outlets for creativity and I LOVE them. I love seeing good artists draw their interpretations of characters I like and if scenes/stills from the show. Cosplays are really cool too. The effort people put in to dressing up is very commendable and I enjoy a majority of them because you know that good cosplayers enjoy the source material and search up reference a lot. Once the next couple arcs are animated, I think we’re gonna get so really fucking nice cosplays of characters with new designs and great imagery based on scenes from the anime.', 'TL;DR: Most people are casual anine watchers, they aren’t going to get to the nitty gritty of the story, nor do they even know where or how to read manga. So they are excited about the things in this show that are great, which is mostly the characters at this point in time. There’s not much people can do other than talk about the same thing over and over or get creative with their talents. I really don’t see anything wrong with this sub.', 'I appreciate you typing this out, I agree with a lot of your points. I think even though its only one season, there\'s still plenty to talk about (predictions, theories, ability analyses, etc.) I just found out about r/Jujutsushi, so I\'ll be spending a lot more time there. Like I said, I don\'t want to be a stickler, I agree a lot of the art and cosplay are dope. Its just that\'s all I ever see on the sub. I think the mods could do some organization of maybe ""discussion days"" or something but idk. Just my two cents though, again I acknowledge and appreciate your perspective.', ""I don't know why I felt I needed to type this but some casuals like myself also like to  read the manga and engage in a few discussions like what is going to happen in the next chapter or what our thoughts were but   don't enter extremely serious discussions"", 'But your still correct either way', ""I agree, but every single manga/anime sub is like this.
